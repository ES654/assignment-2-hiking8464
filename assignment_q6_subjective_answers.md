------

> In q6 we need to plot magnitude of theta vs degree for varying samples (i.e. varying N) using the function we written in q4 and the code used to plot the magnitude of theta vs degree in q5.
> When we are increasing the value of N the overfitting extent increases with the increase in N that results in the increase of the theta for the same degree.
> The link to the plot is provided below.
