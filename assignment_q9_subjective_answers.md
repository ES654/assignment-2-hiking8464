> In q9 after creating a dataset randomly I have added the multicolinearity by adding a column that already exists in the dataset. If we implement the gradient descent implementation in either non-vectorised form or vectorised form using fit_non_vectorised or fit_vectorised functions in linearRegression.py.
> If we execute q9_dataset.py we can see that it works and prints the root mean square error and mean absolute error.
