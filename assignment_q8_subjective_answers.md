> In q8 we are calculated the time required for gradient descnet/ normal equation method using the respective functions in linearRegression.py for fitting X,y. 
> I have plotted two plots one has (varying samples(varying N) vs time required for gradient descent method and varying samples(varying N) vs time required for normal equation method and the other plot has (varying features(varying M) vs time required for gradient descent method and varying features(varying M) vs time required for normal equation method
> Here are the links to both plots.
